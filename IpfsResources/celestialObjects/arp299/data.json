	"Description":"Arp 299 is a system located about 140 million light years from Earth. It contains two galaxies that are merging, creating a partially blended mix of stars from each galaxy. New data from Chandra reveals 25 bright X-ray sources sprinkled throughout the Arp 299 concoction, that astronomers categorize them as 'ultra-luminous X-ray sources' or ULXs."
